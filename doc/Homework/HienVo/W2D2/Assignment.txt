Q1.

Build inverted index using the "Modified" Algorithm.

Input Split 1 (Doc ID 101) [ cat pat mat sat cat eat ]

Input Split 2 (Doc ID 201)  [ pat mat sat pat mat eat]

Input Split 3 (Doc ID 301) [ sat mat cat pat fat mat]

 

Assume three Mappers and two Reducers.

Let cat mat and sat be processed by Reducer 1 and rest by Reducer 2.

Q2. 

Consider the following inverted index:

(964, 17), (1488, 63), (2240, 24), (3168, 32)

Compress using VarInt method
